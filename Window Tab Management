Enum WindowType=TAB,WINDOW constants

Use Case

Let's take a scenario. On our registration page, the address field value comes from different applications, as my address is saved on another application. Up until Selenium 3, it was not possible to open multiple
applications in different tabs or windows. But with Selenium 4, users can open multiple windows and tabs and switch to them automatically. So first we will open our registration page, and then we will open the
application that holds addresses and retrieves addresses into variables. But if we want to return to our first registration page, we need to switch to it.

Code Snippet 

driver.get("URL to land on the application registration page");
//Get all Window Id
String windowId = driver.getWindowHandle();
//Open a new window or tab
driver.switchTo().newWindow(WindowType.WINDOW);
Or
driver.switchTo().newWindow(WindowType.TAB);

//Open another application that holds the address.
driver.get("Other Application URL");
//Retrieve address and store it in a variable
String address = driver.findElement(by Locator)). getText();
//Switch to the First Application 
driver.switchTo().window(windowId);
//Enter your address on the registration page.
driver.findElement(By Locator).sendKeys(address);
