Internal Architecture

Selenium Grid 4 also reveals the internal architecture of the grid, which is missing from Selenium Grid 3 refer https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/architecture/

a)=Router:Receive all requests and forward them to the corresponding node with the help of a session map if they are existing requests, and forward them to the New Session Queue if they are new requests.

b)=Distributor: The distributor deals with two important tasks: first, storing all node capabilities, and second, processing any pending new session requests.

c)=Session Map: Supports the router in the process of forwarding requests to the corresponding node.

d)=Node: Machine where test execution is done.

e)=New Session Queue: holds all new session requests and then, with the help of the distributor, forwards the request to the corresponding node.

f)=Event Bus: Serves as a communication path between nodes, distributors, new session queues, and session maps.

Depending on user requirements The grid is classified into three types. 
a)= Standalone Mode
b)= Hub and node
c)= Distributed 

1)=Standalone Mode=Standalone is the best choice when users want a fully functional grid with a single command. Standalone can only run on a single machine. The server will listen for RemoteWebDriver requests on 
http://localhost:4444. By default, the server will detect the available drivers that it can use from the System PATH. Invoked by the below command

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar standalone

2)=Hub and node=This is the traditional way to use the grid, which consists of two components: hubs and nodes. With this approach, users can combine different machines on a single grid. machines with different
operating systems or browser versions.Invoked by the below command


Starting hub and node on same machine 

Starting Hub

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar hub

Starting node

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node

More than one Node on the same machine 

Node 1=java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --port 5555
Node 2=java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --port 6666

Starting Hub and node on Different machine

3)=Distributed =The best choice for large grid setups where users need to start each grid component(mentioned above) separately.
